### Hello there! 👋

I'm Diandra, based in São Paulo, BR. I have experience as a developer building applications using React, Javascript, TypeScript...

I also had the opportunity to work on projects to teach programming, web concepts to show that technology can be for everyone. I really believe that technology has the power to change people's lives for the better.

- 🔭 I’m working at [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/pt-br) as a Consultant Developer.
