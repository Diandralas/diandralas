### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Diandra, based in SÃ£o Paulo, BR. I have experience building applications using React and landing pages using vanilla Javascript.

I also had the opportunity to work on projects to teach programming, web concepts and logic to show that technology can be for everyone.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about TDD and BDD, accessibility and devops.
